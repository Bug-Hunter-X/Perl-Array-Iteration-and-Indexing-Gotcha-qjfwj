This repository contains a simple Perl program that highlights a common but subtle error related to array iteration. The program demonstrates two different ways to iterate through an array: using indices and using direct value iteration. The solution shows the correct way to handle such iterations, preventing potential off-by-one errors or unexpected results.  Understanding the difference between these methods is crucial for writing correct and robust Perl code.
